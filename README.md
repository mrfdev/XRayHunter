# XRayHunter
CoreProtect XRay Hunter Plugin for Bukkit

XRayHunter is a tool that is very helpful in the hunt for xrayers. XRayHunter will give you a clear list of the most active miners and the percentages of different ores. Luck has nothing to do with it if the percentages become too high.

**NOTE**: Requires CoreProtect (v21.1+)

Original author and manager of this was R4zorax until v1.2.0. For legacy support please use [this](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/xrayhunter.6225/).

### Features
* It is EXTREMELY light as it retrieves data from [CoreProtect](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/coreprotect.8631/).
* Simple detailed overview with teleport feature for each player.
* You can see the percentage of ores.

### Dependency
* [CoreProtect](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/coreprotect.8631/) v21.1+

XRayHunter is a plugin created by R4zorax. I have been maintaining it for a few years for my own purposes, but I think XRayHunter is a very good tool so I think it should be available to everyone. R4zorax has given me permission to do this. His original work can be found [here](https://github.com/rlf/XRayHunter).
